<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description

According to an article by Matt Schmidt in 2021 on Forbes, the video gaming industry is a ‚Äú$180 billion category that grew more than 20% in 2020‚Äù. It is evident how many people play videos games and spend time communicating to other individuals. As per Schmidt (2021) Twitch ‚Äúhas 15 million daily users, and Discord sees over 140 million monthly users‚Äù with the only/closest to a social media platform for gamers being Reddit.

Further in an article on Medium by ScaleTech in 2021, title ‚ÄúIs Online Gaming The New Social Media in 2021?‚Äù showcases the importance of social media for gamers. As stated by ScaleTech (2021) social interaction ‚Äúamong members of a multiplayer community shares similarities to social media group interaction‚Äù and towards ‚Äúbecoming a social network is a natural evolution that brings the best of both worlds‚Äù.

Rapture is a social media mobile application for gamers.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

#### Design Architecture

`MVC` design architecture used for structuring the project.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* One major highlight was getting the `Firebase database and storage` working üòÖ.
* Adding the ability to `forget and reset` your password.
* The `UI/UX design` following the gaming neon theme ü§©.
* `Custom Validation` throughout Rapture.
* Another highlight is adding the extra functionality of `commenting` on a post üëè.
* The extra functionality of `following and unfollowing` a user.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Small bug where when the user has signed in and opens the application again, it displayes the sign in for split second first.
* Minor bug where the onboarding page count is updated but does not move to the sign in screen.
* `Uploading of images` and `updating profile` information.

### Reviews & Testing

The `Reviews & Testing` was done through a video demonstration, and a google form with questions related to the application.

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

* "Very cool and badass, I like the dark theme and its very suitable to gamers".
* "The theme is cohesive and fits well in the scope of the project".
* "Feeds are accessible and well thought out and well designed. The layout makes sense in the theme of the app".
* "The ability to switch between grid and single view is a nice feature for the feed. Everything else looks nice and seems to work as it should".

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Add the ability to use the `camera` üì∑ for post and profile images.
* Navigate to a user profile via the social feed by clicking on the profile image.
* `Upload of more than one image` for a post, and `video` uploads.
* `Gaming News` section within the application.
